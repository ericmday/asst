# Development Status

**Last Updated:** November 25, 2025
**Current Phase:** Bug Fixes & Stability
**Progress:** 50% (3/8 SDK phases complete + UI complete)

## 🎯 Current Focus

### ✅ Last Task Completed
**Conversation Loading Bug Fix - PARTIAL**

**Problem Identified:**
- Old messages from previous conversations were appearing when loading new conversations
- Race condition: Event listener processing stale responses from previous conversation
- Root cause: Global event listener without conversation-level filtering

**Fix Implemented:**
- ✅ Added version counter (useRef) to track conversation changes
- ✅ Version increments on `loadMessages()` and `clearHistory()`
- ✅ All event handlers (token, tool_use, tool_result, done, error) now guard against stale responses
- ✅ Fixed Conversations.tsx dependency array to include onLoadMessages
- ✅ Modified files:
  - `apps/tauri-shell/src/useAgent.ts` - Added version counter and guards
  - `apps/tauri-shell/src/components/Conversations.tsx` - Fixed dependencies

**Status:** 🚧 INCOMPLETE - Conversation thread not properly clearing between loads
- Version counter prevents cross-contamination of streaming responses
- BUT: Loaded conversation messages still show old content
- Need to investigate: SDK session management, message persistence, or deeper state issues
- Next session: Consider Approach 2 (conversation-scoped IPC) or Approach 3 (state machine)

**Previous Sessions:**
- Session 21: Integrated shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS
- Session 20: Draggable header with data-tauri-drag-region
- Session 19: Compact window mode (90px → 600px) with 5-minute timeout

### ⏭️ Next Task
**Fix Conversation Loading Bug (Priority: HIGH)**

**Issue:** Old messages persist when switching conversations despite version counter fix

**Investigation Needed:**
1. Check if SDK session is properly clearing between conversation loads
2. Verify database message retrieval is correct
3. Investigate if React state is truly being reset
4. Consider implementing conversation-scoped IPC (Approach 2 from plan)
5. Review message ID generation - could be collision causing matches

**Reference:** See `/Users/ericday/.claude/plans/agile-dreaming-goldwasser.md` for detailed analysis

**Alternative Approaches if Current Fix Fails:**
- [ ] Approach 2: Add conversation_id to all IPC protocol messages
- [ ] Approach 3: Implement Zustand state machine with atomic transitions
- [ ] Deep dive: SDK adapter session/conversation management

**Other Pending Tasks:**
- [ ] Add visual timer countdown indicator
- [ ] Window position memory
- [ ] Real-time conversation title updates in sidebar
- [ ] Search/filter conversations
- [ ] SDK Migration Phase 4+ (hooks, permissions, advanced features)

## 💡 Notes for Next Session

### Context to Remember
- Core Tauri shell and React UI are implemented and functional
- Agent runtime using Claude SDK is working with streaming responses
- Focus on minimal footprint and fast startup
- Security is critical: sandbox everything
- UI should feel like ChatGPT desktop but with richer tools

### Key Principles
1. **Fast launch** - No heavy initialization
2. **Minimal RAM** - Long-lived but lightweight
3. **Secure by default** - Whitelist everything
4. **Easy extensibility** - Simple to add tools

### Where We Left Off
- ✅ Phase 4 Complete - UI Polish fully complete!
- ✅ Phase 6-9 Roadmap defined with clear priorities
- ✅ Strategic pivot: Focus on prototype features over production packaging
- 🚧 Phase 6 In Progress - Essential Extensions
- 📋 Implementing: Clipboard, Vision, Persistence, Custom Tools
- Next Steps:
  1. Install clipboardy and create clipboard tools
  2. Create vision tools for screenshots and image analysis
  3. Set up SQLite persistence layer
  4. Build custom tool script loader
  5. Test all new features end-to-end
